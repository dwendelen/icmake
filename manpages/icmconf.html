<h2>icmake.8.00.00.tar.gz configuration file for <strong>icmbuild</strong>(1)</h2>
<h2>1992-2015</h2>


<p>

<h2>NAME</h2>icmconf - Configuration file for the <strong>icmbuild</strong>(1) 
                    program maintenance script
<p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
The <strong>icmconf</strong> configuration file is used to specify and tailor the
characteristics of program maintenance performed by the <strong>icmbuild</strong>(1) icmake
script. It can be used to activate and specify various directives that
determine how the program or library maintenance will proceed. 
<p>
The directives are biased towards the construction of a <strong>C++</strong> program, but
program maintenance for other languages (e.g., <strong>C</strong>) can easily be realized
as well. 
<p>
<h2>CLASS DEPENDENCIES</h2>
<p>
Traditional make-utilities recompile sources once header files are
modified. In the context of <strong>C++</strong> program development this is often a bad
idea, as adding a new member to a class does not normally require you to
recompile the class's sources. To handle class dependencies in a more sensible
way, <strong>icmake</strong>(1)'s <em>CLASSES</em> file may define dependencies among classes. 
<p>
If a class Y depends on class X as in:
        <pre>

  class Y: public X
    {
        ...
    };
        
</pre>

 or as in:
        <pre>

    class Y 
    { 
        X d_y; 
        ...
    };
        
</pre>

    then the sources of class Y should be recompiled if X's data organization
has changed. In cases like these Y depends on X. 
<p>
Such class dependencies can be specified in the CLASSES file using the
form: 
    <pre>

  y   x
    
</pre>
 
 where x and y are the directories holding the respective class sources. Then,
when altering X's data organization, do 'touch x/a', followed by 'icmbuild
program': x's sources as well as the sources in directories (in)directly
depending on x (e.g., y) are then automatically recompiled by icmbuild.
<p>
Multiple dependencies can also be specified. If the class
organization looks like this:
        <pre>

    class Z: public Y
    {
        X d_x;
    };
        
</pre>

    then Z depends on both Y and X. In the CLASSES file this may be indicated
by the line
        <pre>

    z   x   y
        
</pre>

    Indirect dependencies are automatically followed. After changing X's data
organization where CLASSES contains the lines
        <pre>

    x
    y   x
    z   y
        
</pre>

    then 'icmbuild program' results in recompiling all of the sources in
classes x, y and z.
<p>
By default, class-dependencies are not interpreted. To activate them the line
    <pre>

//#define USE_ALL             "a"
    
</pre>

    in the <em>icmconf</em> file must be uncommented:
    <pre>

#define USE_ALL             "a"
    
</pre>

<p>
Empty lines and lines whose first non-blank character is a hash-mark (<em>#</em>)
or whose first non-blank characters are two consecutive forward slashes (//)
are ignored. Long lines can be split over multiple lines by using a final
backslash character at lines which continue at the next line. E.g.,
        <pre>

    name1 depends on     multiple other classes
        
</pre>

<p>
<h2>ICMCONF PARAMETERS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>#define ADD_LIBRARIES       ""</strong><br>
       When a program must be linked against additional libraries (other than
        the name of the program's library itself, if specified at <em>LIBRARY</em>)
        then those libraries should be specified, blank space separated,
        here. E.g., when a program is linked against <em>libbobcat</em> then the
        specification is:
    <pre>

    #define ADD_LIBRARIES   "bobcat"
    
</pre>

<p>
<li><strong>#define ADD_LIBRARY_PATHS  ""</strong><br>
       When the additional libraries (specified at <em>ADD_LIBRARIES</em>) are
        located in non-standard library locations (e.g., not in <em>/lib</em> and
        <em>/usr/lib</em>) then these additional paths are (blank space separated)
        specified here. Specify only the paths, not the <em>-L</em> flags.
<p>
<li><strong>#define CLS</strong><br>
       The <em>clear screen</em> directive. If defined <em>tput clear</em> is called to
        clear the terminal screen before starting the compilation. By default
        it is not defined.
<p>
<li><strong>#define CXX                 "g++"</strong><br>
       The C++ compiler to use. For a <strong>C</strong> compiler use, e.g., <em>#define CC
        "gcc"</em>. Its setting is overruled by an identically named environment
        variable.
<p>
<li><strong>#define CXXFLAGS            "--std=c++14 -Wall -g -O2"</strong><br>
       The compiler options to use. The default options are shown. When the
        <strong>C</strong> compiler is used, use <em>#define CFLAGS</em> rather than
        <em>CXXFLAGS</em>. Its setting is overruled by an identically named
        environment variable.
<p>
<li><strong>#define DEFCOM  "..."</strong><br>
       A <em>DEFCOM</em> directive may be added to the <em>icmconf</em> file by
        <em>icmstart</em>. It may be defined as:
       <pre>

    #define DEFCOM  "program"
        
</pre>

       in which case <em>icmbuild</em> will do program maintenance. Alternatively
        it may be defined as: 
       <pre>

    #define DEFCOM  "program strip"
        
</pre>

       in which case <em>icmbuild</em> will do program maintenance, creating a
        stripped binary program. It may also be defined as
       <pre>

    #define DEFCOM  "library"
       
</pre>

        in which case <em>icmbuild</em> will de library maintenance. 
<p>
If this directive was not added by <strong>icmstart</strong>(1) it can always be
        added to <em>icmconf</em> by hand.
<p>
<li><strong>#define IH                  ".ih"</strong><br>
       The extension used for internal header files. See <em>#define PRECOMP</em>
        below. 
<p>
<li><strong>#define LDFLAGS             ""</strong><br>
       The linker options to use. By default no options are passed to the
        linker. Its setting is overruled by an identically named environment
        variable.
<p>
<li><strong>#define LIBRARY           "modules"</strong><br>
       By default this directive is not defined. If defined a local library is
        constructed. When a binary program is built it will be linked against
        this library rather than to the individual object modules. 
<p>
If a library construction is intended (see also the <em>DEFCOM</em>
        directive), then the <em>LIBRARY</em> directive defines the base name
        (without the <em>lib</em> prefix and without the <em>.a</em> extension) of the
        library to be constructed. 
<p>
After a library construction <em>install static dir</em> installs the static
        library at <em>dir</em>, which <em>install shared dir</em> installs the shared
        library (see below at <em>#define SHARED</em>) at <em>dir</em>.
<p>
<li><strong>#define MAIN                "main.cc"</strong><br>
       The source file defining the <em>int main</em> function. This specification
        may be left as-is or may completely be removed if <strong>icmbuild</strong>(1) is
        used for library maintenance rather than program maintenance.
<p>
<li><strong>#define OBJ_EXT             ".o"</strong><br>
        The extension of object modules created by the compiler.
<p>
<li><strong>#define PARSER_DIR          ""</strong><br>
       The subdirectory containing the parser's specification file. Leave
        empty if no parser class is used and if no parser is generated. 
        The following directives, beginning with <em>PARS</em>, are only
        interpreted when <em>PARSER_DIR</em> is defined as a non-empty string.
<p>
<li><strong>#define PARSFILES           ""</strong><br>
       If the parser specification file named at <em>PARSSPEC</em> itself includes
        additional specification files, then patterns matching these
        additional grammar specification files should be specified here. The
        pattern is interpreted in the directory specified at <em>PARSER_DIR</em>
        and could contain a subdirectory name (e.g. <em>specs/*</em>). When files
        matching the pattern are modified then a new parser will be
        created. By default no additional specification files are used.
<p>
<li><strong>#define PARSFLAGS           "-V"</strong><br>
       The flags to use when calling the program specified at <em>PARSGEN</em>.
<p>
<li><strong>#define PARSGEN             "bisonc++"</strong><br>
       The name of the program generating the parser.
<p>
<li><strong>#define PARSOUT             "parse.cc"</strong><br> 
       The name of the file generated by the parser generator (which is used
        by <em>icmbuild</em> to compare the timestamps of the parser specification
        <strong>s</strong> against).
<p>
<li><strong>#define PARSSPEC            "grammar"</strong><br>
       The name of the parser specification file. This file is
        expected in the directory specified at <em>PARSER_DIR</em>.
<p>
<li><strong>//#define PRECOMP           "-x c++-headers"</strong><br>
       When activated internal header files (see <em>#define IH</em>) are
        precompiled when they are more recent than their precompiled
        versions. They are removed again by <em>icmbuild clean</em>. To specify
        internal header files for other languages change the <em>-x</em>
        specification accordingly. By default this <em>#define</em> is not active.
<p>
<li><strong>#define REFRESH</strong><br>
       Define <em>REFRESH</em> to relink the binary program at every <em>icmbuild
        program</em> call. By default <em>REFRESH</em> is <em>not</em> defined.
<p>
<li><strong>#define SCANNER_DIR         ""</strong><br>
       The subdirectory containing the scanner's specification file. Leave
        empty if no scanner class is used and if no lexical scanner is
        generated. The following directives, beginning with <em>SCAN</em>, are only
        interpreted when <em>SCANNER_DIR</em> is defined as a non-empty string.
<p>
<li><strong>#define SCANFILES            ""</strong><br>
       If the lexical scanner specification file named at <em>SCANSPEC</em> itself
        includes additional specification files, then patterns matching these
        additional lexer specification files should be specified here. The
        pattern is interpreted in the directory specified at <em>SCANNER_DIR</em>
        and could contain a subdirectory name (e.g. <em>specs/*</em>). When files
        matching the pattern are modified then a new lexical scanner will be
        created. By default no additional specification files are used.
<p>
<li><strong>#define SCANFLAGS           ""</strong><br>
       The flags to use when calling the program specified at <em>SCANGEN</em>.
<p>
<li><strong>#define SCANGEN             "flexc++"</strong><br>
       The name of the program generating the lexical scanner.
<p>
<li><strong>#define SCANOUT             "lex.cc"</strong><br>
       The name of the file generated by the lexical scanner (which is used by
        <em>icmbuild</em> to compare the timestamps of the scanner specification
        <strong>s</strong> against).
<p>
<li><strong>#define SCANSPEC            "lexer"</strong><br>
       The name of the lexical scanner specification file. This file is
        expected in the directory specified at <em>SCANNER_DIR</em>.
<p>
<li><strong>#define SHARED</strong><br>
       This directive is only interpreted if <em>LIBRARY</em> was also specified.
        If defined a static library (extension <em>.a</em>) as well as a shared
        library (extension <em>.so*</em>) is built. If not specified, but
        <em>LIBRARY</em> was specified, only the static library is built. By
        default <em>SHARED</em> is not defined.
<p>
The shared library receives as its major version number <em>VERSION</em>'s
        major version number, and receives <em>VERSION</em> as its full version
        number. E.g., if <em>VERSION</em> is defined as <em>1.02.03</em> and <em>LIBRARY</em>
        is defined as <em>demo</em> then the shared library <em>libdemo.so.1.02.03</em>
        is constructed, with <em>libdemo.so.1</em> soft-linking to it, with
        <em>libdemo.so</em> in turn soft-linking to <em>libdemo.so.1</em>.
<p>
<li><strong>#define SHAREDREQ           ""</strong><br>
       When creating a shared library <em>SHAREDREQ</em> specifies the names of
        libraries and library paths that are required by the shared library.
        E.g., if a library is found in <em>/usr/lib/special</em>, assuming that the
        name of the required library is <em>libspecial.so</em>, then use the
        specification <em>"-L/usr/lib/special -lspecial"</em>.  The <em>/lib</em> and
        <em>/usr/lib</em> paths are usually predefined and need not be
        specified. This directive is only interpreted if <em>SHARED</em> and
        <em>LIBRARY</em> were also defined.
<p>
<li><strong>#define SOURCES             "*.cc"</strong><br>
       The pattern to locate sources in a directory. The default value is
        shown. 
<p>
<li><strong>#define TMP_DIR             "tmp"</strong><br>
       The directory in which intermediate results are stored. Relative to the
        current working directory unless an absolute path is specified.
<p>
<li><strong>#define USE_ALL     "a"</strong><br>
       After defining this directive (by default it is <em>not</em> defined) a
        class dependency setup defined in the CLASSES file is interpreted. In
        this case, when a directory contains a file named at the <em>USE_ALL</em>
        directive, then all sources of that class as well as all sources of
        all classes depending on it are (re)compiled. The program's root
        directory is assumed to depend on all other directories.
<p>
Class dependencies in CLASSES consist of the class name (as the first
        word on a line) optionally followed by additional class names, which
        are the classes on which the line's first class name depends. 
<p>
Assuming that a program uses five classes <em>One, Two, Three, Four</em> and
        <em>Five</em> and that class <em>Three</em> depends on class <em>Two</em>, which in
        turn depends on class <em>One</em>, while class <em>Five</em> depends on
        <em>Three</em> and <em>Four</em>, then the file <em>CLASSES</em> may reflect these
        dependencies as follows: 
            <pre>

    one
    two     one
    three   two
    four
    five three four 
</pre>
 
    Now touching (creating) the file <em>two/a</em> (using e.g., the command
<em>touch two/a</em>) causes all sources of the classes <em>Two, Three</em> and <em>Five</em>
as well as all the sources in the program's root directory to be recompiled:
<em>Two</em> is recompiled because of the existence of <em>two/a</em>, <em>Three</em> is
recompiled because it depends on <em>Two</em>, <em>Five</em> is recompiled because it
depends on <em>Three</em>, the sources in the program's root directory are
recompiled because at least one directory is recompiled.
<p>
This facility was added to the <em>icmbuild</em> script because <strong>C++</strong> header
files are often modified <em>without</em> the need to recompile all their depending
sources. No recompilation is necessary when a new class member function is
declared. Recompilation, however, <em>is</em> necessary when the class's internal
organization changes, e.g., when the organization of its data members is
modified. Simply touching a file <em>"a"</em> is sufficient to perform 
the necessary recompilations.
<p>
Following the recompilations the <em>USE_ALL</em> <strong>s</strong> are removed.  
<p>
When the <em>USE_ALL</em> directive was defined the command <em>icmbuild
clean</em> also removes any leftover <em>USE_ALL</em> files from the program's direct
subdirectories.
<p>
<li><strong>#define USE_ECHO              ON</strong><br>
        When specified as <em>ON</em> (rather than <em>OFF</em>) commands executed by
        <em>icmbuild</em> are echoed.
<p>
<li><strong>#define USE_VERSION</strong><br>
       If defined (which is the default) the file <em>VERSION</em> is read by
        <em>icmconf</em> to determine the program/library's version, and the
        project's release years.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>OBSOLETE DIRECTIVES</h2>
