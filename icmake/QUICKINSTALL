0. After unpacking the icmake_X.YY.tar.gz icmake archive, make your current
   working directory equal to the directory in which you found this file.

1. Inspect and modify if necessary the current locations in INSTALL.im.

2. If you want the compiler to insert debugging code in the icmake programs
   then define a CFLAGS environment variable. E.g., 
                CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -g"

3. To prepare for the compilations of the programs, run 
                ./icm_prepare /

3. Compile the various programs:
                ./icm_bootstrap x

4. As root: install the programs and documentation:
                ./icm_install strip all
                    
5. Remove intermediate construction area:
                rm -rf tmp



Following these commands (referring to the #defines in INSTALL.im):
    
    icmake is in /BINDIR
    skeleton files, installed by icmstart, are in /SKELDIR
    manual pages are in /MANDIR/man{1,7}
    icmake support programs are in /LIBDIR
    confguration files, specifying which skeleton commands to install, are in
        /CONFDIR
    icmake documentation is installed in /DOCDIR and /DOCDOCDIR
