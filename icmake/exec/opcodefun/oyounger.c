/*
    This function is executed when an {\em op\_younger} opcode is found in
    the binary makefile. Two variables are popped and their {\em valuestr}
    fields are used as file names to compare two files. The result of the
    comparison is pushed as an {\em e\_int} variable.

    Note that the right operand of the {\em younger} operator is popped
    first since the left operand is expected to be pushed first.
